# Electrical Impedance Tomography Enhanced by Magnetical Readings

This repository was made for the conference paper __Enhance electrical impedance tomography withmagnetic readings__
for the [BMS 2024 conference in Villingen-Schwenningen](https://www.bms-24.org/), where it won a poster prize award.


## What you need to run this code

- Matlab (it was tested with Matlab R2023b on a linux machine)

- A matlab function called `init_eidors.mat` available to your path containing
`run /path/to/eidors3d/startup.m` (see [EIDORS first tutorial](https://eidors3d.sourceforge.net/tutorial/EIDORS_basics/one_line.shtml))


## How to use this repository

By running `all_analysis_and_plot.m` you will get figure 1, and 2, of the conference paper plus additional plots that were used for the poster.
Please note that the figures you will get need formatting to appear exactly as those of the conference paper.
